Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data for #Amazon and #eBay Hashtags
This project involves performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to the hashtags #Amazon and #eBay. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that aims to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet.

Overview
Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding public opinion and customer sentiments towards specific brands or topics. By analyzing tweets related to #Amazon and #eBay, we can gain insights into how users feel about these e-commerce giants and their products/services.

Data Collection
To conduct this sentiment analysis, we collect a significant number of tweets containing the hashtags #Amazon and #eBay. The data can be collected using the Twitter API or other third-party services that provide access to Twitter data.

Text Preprocessing
Before performing sentiment analysis, we preprocess the collected tweets to clean the data and remove noise. Text preprocessing steps may include:

Removing special characters, URLs, and hashtags.
Converting text to lowercase.
Tokenization (splitting text into individual words or tokens).
Removing stop words (common words with little semantic value).
Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis is carried out using machine learning or deep learning models. Commonly used techniques include:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A rule-based model that uses a lexicon of words with sentiment scores to determine the overall sentiment of a piece of text.

Machine Learning Classifiers: Training classifiers (such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forests) on labeled data to predict sentiment for new tweets.

Deep Learning Models: Utilizing deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, to learn the context and sentiment of tweets.

Visualization and Analysis
After performing sentiment analysis, the results can be visualized using charts or graphs to present an overall sentiment distribution for both #Amazon and #eBay hashtags. The sentiment distribution can include positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

Insights and Conclusions
Based on the sentiment analysis results, we can draw insights and conclusions about how the Twitter community perceives both Amazon and eBay. For example:

Are there more positive or negative sentiments towards each brand?
What are the common themes or topics mentioned in positive/negative tweets?
How do sentiment patterns change over time or during specific events/campaigns?
Limitations
It's essential to consider the limitations of sentiment analysis, such as the potential for sarcasm, context-dependent sentiments, and language variations.

Contributions
We welcome contributions to improve the sentiment analysis process, explore different models, and analyze other relevant hashtags or brands.
